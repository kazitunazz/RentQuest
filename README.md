The application provides separate functionalities for property owners and tenants. It keeps track of tenant to owner request 
details using session/ cookies. Each owner can publish circulars for multiple properties which can be edited or deleted later. 
The same tenant can't send request to the owner for the same property during different logins. 
Tenants can add properties to the wishlist and send multiple visit requests to different owners of different properties at the same time. 
Owners can sort the requests based on time and date. The application incorporates attractive and responsive UI.
